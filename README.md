# theblood
I am teaching myself piano and musical theory. `theblood` is an exercise to program the logic behind theory in an effort to better understand it.

### Coding Philosophy
Because the primary goal of this repo is to aid in learning the concepts and gritty details of musical theory, the primargy goal of the syntax and style used will be to express the code as identically as possible to the language used in expressing musical theory. At times, I may sacrifice succintness and speed for the sake of readability and expressiveness, though part of my intent is to improve both my expressive and efficiency skills.

### My Music
I've been playing guitar for a long time though I never learned any theory. I played in some bands and have written my own songs as well. Lately I've been posting my works-in-progress on YouTube. These include some folky guitar songs as well as piano-based chamber music. Recording myself playing and practicing has helped improve my skills immensely. Here are the latest versions of songs I've written: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZFJs2kjpu_1-q63aNlu6xbS5MOfmiWYc>. 

Much of my practice takes the form of improvisation. I often record these improvisations, which sometimes turn into actual songs. Here are improvisations I've recorded: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZFJs2kjpu_0USMtYUsG-XnDiqR7C-s2n>
